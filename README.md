# Capstone
Capstone project for ML Engineer Nanodegree

In this project, I pull up a dataset of housing sales around Melbourne, Australia and perform principal components analysis, make a few plots using a package called Yellowbrick, and perform Gaussian Mixture model clustering. Clusters were evaluated with silhouette scores.

Next, I try to predict which city a house is in using boosted decision trees (XGBoost).

Little data cleaning was required but there were several innacurate entries. All analysis work was reported in the Summary pdf, also attached is my cleaned-up dataset.

Notably, the decision tree model was compared to other, less complex algorithms and fared a lot better, even untuned.
