# Capstone
Capstone project for ML Engineer Nanodegree

In this project, I pull up a dataset of housing sales around Melbourne, Australia and perform principal components analysis, make a few plots using a package called Yellowbrick, and perform Gaussian Mixture model clustering. Clusters were evaluated with silhouette scores.

Next, I try to predict which city a house is in using boosted decision trees (XGBoost).

Little data cleaning was required but there were several innacurate entries.
